Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project dealt with data input such as initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest, number of years. We were required to come up with a code that can test different year end balances with and without additional monthly deposits. This also told the user about the monthly deposit amounts, interest rate and length of time to see how their investments increased or decreased in years to come. 

What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I got a pretty good understanding of a lot of things in project two. I found this assignment relatively simple and fun. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think this code could have been more detailed in ways of how the data was laid out. I'm not saying it wasn't detailed enough but it would have been cool to add some more detailing features. I think the code is pretty simple and secure. This is a reliable code and it can be used in another banking app.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I didn't really have any difficulty writing the code. It took a little bit to brainstorm to make sure that it met all the required assignments. The Functional Requirements helped me paint a good mental picture of how I wanted to pursue this assignment.  

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project has a lot of basic coding techniques displayed in it. I think this is a good project to look at to give ideas for another assignment. You can benefit a lot just reading and looking at the code itself. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I simply just applied a simple code that is functionable, readable and useful for other projects. I think the more simple the code, the most functionable itâ€™ll be in a lot of things.
